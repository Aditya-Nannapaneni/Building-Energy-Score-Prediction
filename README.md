# Building-Energy-Score-Prediction


Results:
-	Developed a naive baseline model to compare against 5 machine learning algorithms (Linear/SVM/Random Forest/Gradient Boosting/KNN Regression), used Mean Absolute   Error (MAE) as evaluation metric.
-	Tuned Hyperparameters using Random Search & 4-fold Cross Validation to predict the Energy Star Score of a building to within 10 points.
